# Hyprland Logo Cursor Theme 
A scalable custom cursor theme based on by the built-in Hyprland logo icon cursor, both xcursor and hyprcursor versions.
## Features
- Works aross Wayland, GTK, Hyprland, QT and XWayland, they all obey and bend to the will;
- Original logo is 32px, XCursor demands that 24, 48, 64 and 96 sizes also better be present for resizing to work;
- E.g. in your Gentoo setup it's gonna work smoothly and uniformly across kitty, nwg-look, waybar, vlc and such - all these guys just LOVE using each their own fallback source, if they get capricious for any reason (I don't use Arch btw ;-) (though I think it's also a fine distro ;-)
## Installation, XCursor
- git clone or download cursors dir structure and place it into ~/.local/share/icons/hyprland_theme/
- set up soft links to this file in the same dir, at the very least called default, left_ptr, arrow **this is a call on the original hyprland logo designer to make a proper theme :-)**
- git clone or download index.theme and place it into ~/.local/share/icons/hyprland_theme/
- [optional] if you wanna make from source, get the png's and the conf instead, and run xcursorgen hyprland_logo_cursor.conf hyprland_theme
- change in hyprland.conf or export otherwise XCURSOR_THEME=hyprland_theme
## Installation, hyprcursor
- git clone or download hyprcursor dir strutcture and place it into ~/.local/share/icons/hyprcursor_logo/
- git clone or download manifest.hl and place it into ~/.local/share/icons/hyprcursor_logo/
- change in hyprland.conf or export otherwise HYPRCURSOR_THEME=hyprcursor_logo
## Naughty libs
- for GTK stuff to work, either use ngw-look, or run gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme hyprland_theme
- for QT stuff to work, export (e.g. in hyprland.conf) XCURSOR_PATH=~/.local/share/icons/

### Credits
The logo icon cursor you see in Hyprland when you don't have anything else enabled whatsoever - it was extracted from Hyprland source code, after painstakingly searching for many hours (to simply ask the devs would have been a much better idea, I know ..) with hardly any help even from AI chatbots. Once again, designers are called to make this a full-fledged theme with all the cursor shapes present, and maybe even beyond that.
